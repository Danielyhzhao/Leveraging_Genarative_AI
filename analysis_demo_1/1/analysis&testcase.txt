Analysis Result:
【Logical Errors】
1. The ternary operator's order of operations may be incorrect, leading to incorrect element comparisons. - Approximate region: Code block with ternary operations in both conditions where sum is odd and even.
2. The code may incorrectly compute the median when both arrays have even length. - Approximate region: The block where (len1 + len2) is even and both len1 and len2 are even.
3. The code might not correctly handle cases where the sum of m and n is 1. - Approximate region: The conditional logic when sum is odd.
4. The code may fail to consider when len1 or len2 is zero. - Approximate region: The conditional logic for when len1 or len2 is zero.

【Test Cases】

Expected: -0.5


一个point要生成2-3个test case，test case要分类对应每一个问题
试两个不同的llm，使用同一种方法
需要查看llm生成的逻辑错误是否正确
试多几条问题看是否合适
