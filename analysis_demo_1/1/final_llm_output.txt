### Analysis and Suggestions for Improvement

#### 1. Handling Edge Cases: Empty Arrays
**Issue:** The code does not handle cases where one of the arrays is empty, leading to an `IndexError` in some test cases.
- **Test Case:** `[], [1,3]` (Expected: 2.0)
- **Line Numbers:** Lines 6-14 (logic when sum is odd), Lines 17-35 (logic when sum is even)

**Suggestion:** Before diving into the main logic, add checks at the beginning of the function to handle scenarios where either `nums1` or `nums2` is empty. This will prevent index out-of-range errors.

#### 2. Incorrect Median Calculation for Odd Total Length
**Issue:** The logic for finding the median when the total length is odd is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that the middle element can be found by comparing the middle elements of each array directly.
- **Test Case:** `[0,5,7], [0,3,5,9]` (Expected: 4.0, but got 5)
- **Line Numbers:** Lines 6-14

**Suggestion:** Instead of directly comparing the middle elements, consider merging the two arrays up to the middle point and then selecting the correct middle element. Alternatively, use a binary search approach to find the median efficiently without fully merging the arrays.

#### 3. Incorrect Median Calculation for Even Total Length
**Issue:** The logic for finding the median when the total length is even also has issues. It incorrectly calculates the average of the two middle elements.
- **Test Case:** `[1,2], [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]` (Expected: 4.5, but got 6.5)
- **Line Numbers:** Lines 16-35

**Suggestion:** Ensure that you are correctly identifying the two middle elements from the combined sorted sequence. You may need to adjust how you calculate the indices for these middle elements based on the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`. Consider using a binary search to find the partition points in both arrays that would give you the correct middle elements.

#### 4. General Algorithmic Improvement
**Issue:** The current approach does not meet the O(log(m + n)) time complexity requirement due to incorrect handling of array indices and potential full array merging.
- **Line Numbers:** Entire function

**Suggestion:** Implement a binary search algorithm that works by partitioning both arrays such that the left part contains the smaller half of the elements and the right part contains the larger half. This ensures that you only traverse logarithmic sections of the arrays, meeting the required time complexity. Focus on finding the correct partition points that satisfy the condition for medians in merged sorted arrays.

#### 5. Simplifying Logic
**Issue:** The logic is overly complex and hard to follow, making it prone to errors.
- **Line Numbers:** Lines 6-35

**Suggestion:** Simplify the logic by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. For instance, first check if any array is empty, then handle the case where the total number of elements is odd, and finally handle the case where the total number of elements is even. Use helper functions if necessary to make the code more readable and maintainable.
